# BlurIt-api
This is the backend code for the BlurIt fullstack app I have made with the PERN stack. The reason for a separate repo is for easier deployment onto Render with their free packages. Eventually, I will change the deployment to Hiroku with a Student Developer pack and will update this accordingly.
