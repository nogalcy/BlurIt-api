### This is the backend only to make deploying on Render easier, the frontend is [here](https://github.com/nogalcy/BlurIt) and the site is [here](https://blurit.onrender.com/)

# BlurIt-api
This is the backend code for the BlurIt fullstack app I have made with the PERN stack. The reason for a separate repo is for easier deployment onto Render with their free packages. Eventually, I will change the deployment to Hiroku with a Student Developer pack and will update this accordingly.
